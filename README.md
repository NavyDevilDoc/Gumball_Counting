# Gumball_Counting
One day, my ex-wife and I were out to breakfast (when we were still married, mind you) and we saw a gumball machine at the restaurant. I started wondering how one might estimate the number of gumballs in the machine. This particular project was interesting because I really dug into sphere packing, an area with which I was fairly unfamiliar.


Assumptions:
1) The jar is a uniform cylinder. In other words, it's a garden variety jar with no fluctuations in its composition.
2) Constants were either direct measurements or researched
3) Ten percent of the gumballs were selected at random and measured using a caliper to get an accurate estimation of the average diameter.

To validate the model, I paid my 12 y/o son to count the gumballs for an accurate number. Then, he separated the gumballs by color and noted the count on a sticky note, which gave me an exact number of gumballs per bag. There were 659 gumballs in the bag and five experiments were conducted to match the predicted and actual number of gumballs in the jar by simply picking random bags, adding their contents to the jar, measuring from the inside bottom of the jar to the top level of the gumballs to get the height and free space, then running the model for comparison against the actual number. The average experimental accuracy over 30 trials was 97%, which made me irrationally giddy.

Go get yourself a bag of gumballs and see what you come up with!
